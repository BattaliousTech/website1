	<h1 style="color:dimgray;text-align;center"> Welcome to Battalious Tech!</h1>
	<h2 style="color:dimgray"> How Battalious Tech came to be </h2>
		<p>This group was created by a 14 year old highschool student who got bored and decided to start a company.<br /> What he decided to do was think of ideas for what he could and thought of making a small organization where he could actually do three things he loves which are Coding, Building computers, and Gaming. <br />		This small soon-to-be company will be building computers, creating programs, creating and testing games, and provide tech support in some areas.</p>
	<h2 style="color:gray"> What we will be doing? </h2>
	<h3 style="color:darkslategray"> Building work/gaming computers</h2>
		<p> Computers may be simple to build once you get the hang of it but they cost a lot of money so at the beginning we will start only be building low-end gaming/work pc's.</p>
	<h3 style="color:darkslategray"> Creating custom tools and utilities.</h2>
		<p> We will be creating new programs for different things. Whether it be a program to help begininners code their own websites or for large companies to easily expand their workforce with a job finding app, all of it will be made by us sometime in the future.</p>
	<h3 style="color:darkslategray"> Creating and testing video games </h3>
		<p> We will be making simple (and free) flash and HTML5 games and will soon start using more difficult coding languages.<p>
